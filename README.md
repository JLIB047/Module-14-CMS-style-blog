# Module-14-CMS-style-blog

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to further my knowledge of the MVC paradigm to organize our full stack applications.  The application is a tech blog where users can post articles, comment and read other user's posts.  You are able to login, view posts, and create your own posts.  My app keeps giving me an internal server error, it looks like it's not reading the post.title and post.content fields. I've been reviewing my code for days and tested all my routes. When reviewing could you add some insite as to what may be wrong?

# Module-14-CMS-style-blog

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to further my knowledge of the MVC paradigm to organize full stack applications.  The application is a tech blog where users can post articles, comment and read other user's posts.  You are able to login/sign-up, view posts, create post, comment and edit posts.  I had some difficulties in my post routes communicating wiht my front javascript the most. But with the help of tutors, TA's and Ask BCS I was able to figure it out.  Also, posting to heroku with JawsDB seemed more complicated than it needs to be.
